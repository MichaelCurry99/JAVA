  <h1> Learning JavaScript</h1>

   <h2>What I've learned about JavaScript</h2>
   <h3> <p> As a beginner who is just learning about how to start a Javascript page, the first
        question you'd ask is, what does this language do? From what I've seen, It looks to be as similar as an HTML,
    but I'm sure you'd have to use different symbols in order to get a certain thing to happen. I've learned about how to use variables
    which seem to be something different. Using these variables may have some purpose, though I'm not sure exactly what that is. I will have the proper use
    to solve this type of programming language.</p> 

    <p>I've also learned how computers work by learning from those who were highly skilled in their field of technology. Remembering the first computers of the 
        previous centuries, they were very massive and were a lot difficult to use than as of today. The circuit boards are the most intriguing part of learning about the
        CPU and are very important in operating your computer. Now, creating circuits can be difficult since they're so tiny as well as easy to operate with circuit codes "1"
        and "0". There is so much that the world of technology can hold, and it's with us everyday!</p>
